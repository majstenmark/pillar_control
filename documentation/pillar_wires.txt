Here we describe the wires that come out directly from the pillar
(inside a thicker wire, which we cut at its end), and how to 
connect them to the control card inside the box that contains 
the transformer.

Warning: The supply voltage for the pillar is 24V. Never connect 24V to the potentiometer, which is fed by 5.5V.

We use this formatting formating:
Wire appearance - wire function - port on card to connect to (1-14, printed on the card).

First, let's consider the supply voltage from the transformer.
Black wire from Linak transformer - supply 0V - Connect to 1
Red wire from Linak transformer - supply 24V - Connect to 4


The following wires are inside the pillar cable. 
Thick cables are for the motor. Thin cables are for potentioimeter.
Black - potentiometer 0V - 8
Yellow: Nothing. Do not connect.
Blue - Motor+ - 3
Orange - Potentiometer out - 9
Red - Potentiometer feed 5.5V - 14
Brown - Motor minus - 2
